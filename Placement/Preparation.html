    <p><b>***</b> Before reading this article you must know this <a href="servicebasedVSproductbased.html">Service based vs Product based</a> and <a href="Howtoapply.html">How to apply for off-campus.</a></p>
     

   <p>The placement session for any company generally has 3 â€“ 4 rounds. The first round is the written test, consisting of quantitative aptitude, reasoning (logical ability), English (verbal ability) and computer science subjects (C, C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, DBMS, OS, Networks, etc.).
    For some companies, you might also have a coding round, which is sometimes taken as a separate round and sometimes is clubbed with the written test.
    Further rounds are interview rounds, the first two usually being the technical round and successive rounds being the HR round.</p> 
   
 <!-- <h2>Language</h2>

 <p><b>Java: </b> For learning Java You must visit the playlist of Java by Anuj Kumar Sharma in Apni Kaksha Channel.I also learned Java from there.</p> 

 <p><b>C++:</b> C++ full course in 4 hours by coding bootcamp or you can learn from Apna college.</p>
     -->


 <h2>Aptitude</h2>
<ul>
 <li><b>Best Website:</b> <a href="https://www.indiabix.com/aptitude/questions-and-answers/">India Bix</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/aptitude-gq/">GeeksforGeeks</a>, <a href="https://placement.freshersworld.com/quantitative-aptitude-questions-and-answers/33150826">Freshersworld.</a> for learning concept and question practicing.</li>
 
 <li><b>Book:</b> R.S. Agrawal (do not try to do all the questions from this book.)</li>
