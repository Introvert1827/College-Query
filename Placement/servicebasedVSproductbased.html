          <li>The above article only giving a difference and not intended that services based company are bad.  </li>
          <br>
          <li>Since its difficult to get land into a product based company and many student are not able to do it. </li>
          <br>
          <li>So for having a backup you can try on service based company as well.</li>
          <br>
          <li>"It's to better to have a job in service based rather than to being  unemployee after B Tech.</li>
          <br>
          <li>You can also switch your job from service based to product based if you able to manage your job and preparation.</li>
