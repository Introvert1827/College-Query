 <h1>Answer:</h1>

 <p>No, Certificate not matter. No company is going to ask you for certificate of particular language(C++,Java) or technology(ML,AI).You only have to mention on your resume the name of language or technology you know. Make sure that you mention only those thing in which you have good grip because the interviewer will judge your knowledge by  asking  question related to it.</p>

 <p><b>Note: </b>For getting  an interview round of a company you have to first clear the written round or coding round .&#128516</p>
