                    <p>Whenever we give mid-term in college we always confuse about one thing is this marks add up to
                        our final result? Some say "Yes" some replied "No" while other not sure about both of these.So
                        here I am clearing all your doubt regarding mid-term </p>
                    <br>

                    <i>Is it Compulsary to give Mid-term Examination?</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>"YES"</b>It is mandatory to give mid-term Exam untill and unless you have strong valid reason for
                    skipping the exam.Since if you skip the exam without a valid reason So during the time of allocating
                    internal marks teacher check your attendence in a class as well as in mid-term (some teacher check
                    some not).So be on the safe zone its better to attend mid-term exam,getting low or high marks that
                    depends on you but attendence criteria you have to take it seriously.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Marks added to your final result?</i>
                    <br><br>

                    I am not sure about this but RGPV <b>never</b> add mid-term marks in final result of a student.They
                    only add your theory paper marks,pratical marks(alloted by external during viva),internal
                    marks(alloted when you submit practical copy to your subject teacher and viva(if teacher takes)).
                    <br><br>

                    <p><b>Note:</b><i> some teacher gives internal marks based on your mid-term marks and attendence.So
                            make sure you have to atleast attend mid-term.</i></p>

                        secured AIR 1 in GATE 2015. <br><br>
                        Although if your target is some PSUs and other recruitments through GATE then it could be a
                        barrier to give GATE from other stream as opposed to your graduation stream .These companies
