        <h1>First Year Roadmap</h1>
         
        <p><b><i>Here are some pro tips that you must follow in first year inorder to get good result in future</i></b></p>
        
        <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px; background-color: rgb(28, 197, 98) ;"><p><b>Note :-</b>Follow the below procedure only if you want to get into the <b>software</b> field.</p></div>
        
        <p>Some of the below step might confuse you  if you heard this first time , but don't get stuck on it by time of learning you will familiar with this. </p>
        
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>Learn any programming language  either C++ or Java. I never prefer you to start with python (even though it is very beginner friendly) because you get more conceptual clarity in learning C++ and Java.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Now if you are familiar with the any programming language  and know some basic syntax, it's is time to learn <b>some </b>Data Structure and Algorithm ( I am <b>not</b> saying all only some).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Go to Geeks for Geeks portal click on Data Structure section and start with linked list. I prefer you learn from youtube videos then read article of geeksforgeeks and practice on them.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Since it may take some time so be patience and don't give up after 2 or 3 months of practice.</li>
            <br>
            <li>During learning data structure you might find somewhere the word "Algorithm" for example by using "Two Pointer Algorithm" so when you learning data structure you simultaneaously learning some algorithm as well.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Since learning data structure and algorithm and solving problem on them is never ending process and it is improves by day to day practice.</li>
            <br>

            <li style="line-height: 30px;">Practice problem and participate in contest from different website like :
                
                <ul>
                    <li>HackerEarth</li>
                    <li>HackerRank</li>
                    <li>CodeChef</li>
                    <li>Codeforces</li>
                    <li>leetcode</li>
                    <li>Interview bit</li>
                </ul>

            </li>

           <br>

          <li>By solving problem and participating  in contest help you to increase your problem solving skill which is a prequsite as a software enginner</li>
        
        </ul>

     <br>

  <div style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: lightblue;">
        
    <b>Note : </b>
            
        <ul style = "list-style: square; line-height: 20px;">
           
             <li>You face some time constraints here because there are lot other things that you have to do in your freshman year like understanding college syllabus and exam pattern, making friends, scholarship form etc.</li>
             <br>

             <li>So try to give some fixed 2-3 hours on daily basis.</li>
             <br>

             <li>Give more time on sundays and winter and summer break.</li>
             <br>

             <li>If you come in 2nd year and not able complete data structure algorithm then no need to worry about that, as I said its never ending process and you have to practice it on daily basis.You can move to 2nd year roadmap as you come in 2nd year.</li>
