    <p>I hope you follow the first year roadmap properly now its time to follow second year.</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Since you all are now comfortable with basic understanding of programming language (C++ or Java) and
            <b>some</b> data Structure and algorithm.If you not do that then first finish that then you come in this
            section. Now it's time give some hands on development side.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Please note one thing development has <b>no relation</b> with what you learn so far, as it is a different game.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>So there are different ways to do  development,it's upto you what you like :
            
            <ul>
                <li>Web Development
                    <ul>
                        <li>front-End</li>
                        <li>back-End</li>
                        <li>full stack (both back-end and front-end)</li>
                    </ul>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                
                <li>Machine Learning etc.</li>

             </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        
        <li>Choose any one try to become expert on that and after you are get familiar with it make some good project on that which you will later add on your resume.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li>Learn some tools like <b>Git and GitHub</b> which help you how you can store your project remotely.</li>
        <br>
        

        <!-- <li>learn HTML, CSS by watching Youtube tutorial also practice it at same time.</li>
        <br> -->

        <!-- <li>For HTML click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXPWs00RD3A">here</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            For CSS click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyxzAU3p8CE">here</a></li>
        <br>

        <li>Since I learn html and css from above tutorial you can explore other tutorial as well according to what you
            like.</li>
        <br>

        <li>After learning html and css try to build some static website by watching video tutorial, which help you get
            knowledge about how to give structure to the website and how to design it.</li>
        <br>

        <li>After getting familiar with html , css and static website it's time to learn how make responsive website,
            since more than 90% of website in internet are responsive.</li>
        <br>

        <p><b>Responsive Website:-</b> Website which perfrom some actions when we click on some specified options or
            icons given by website.</p>

        <li>So for making your website responsive you have to learn <b>JavaScript</b> (most used programming language in
            industry).</li>
        <br>

        <li>I learn JavaScirpt(JS) from W3School website you can learn from any where its up to you there are 1000 video
            tuttorial on youtube.</li>
        <br> -->

        <li>Apart from don't this  forget to practice question on DSA (Data Structure and Algorithm) side by side by giving
            some fixed hours to DSA problem on daily basis. Also try CP(Competative Programming)
            by giving live contest on different website like <a href="https://www.codechef.com/">Codechef</a> , <a
                href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> . Increase your rating on this website which
            definately help you in getting job in product based company, if you are <span style="color: rgb(255, 75, 4);">5 star</span> or above on codechef <b>OR</b>

            <li>
                So after learning all this you able to design frontend part of the website,but what about backend how we
                can store our website data base in server, Since I not did backend development so I not able to guide
                you about this :( .

        </ul>

        <b>Note:-</b>

        <ul>
            <li>Is FrontEnd Development is <b>JavaScript, HTML and CSS only. </b> ?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Ans:-</b> No, there are other things as well like frontEnd frameworks (<b>React,Angular</b> which are
            javascript library),&nbsp;<b>Bootstrap</b> (CSS library). etc</p>
